# Intrusion Detection with Decision Trees

This project applies machine learning, using the Decision Tree algorithm, to detect network intrusions. It utilizes the NSL-KDD dataset from [CIC-Datasets](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html).

## Overview

Detect and classify network attacks using Decision Trees.

## Features

- Decision Tree algorithm for intrusion detection.
- NSL-KDD dataset for benchmarking.
- Learning resource for network security with machine learning.
- Detects various network attack types.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies.
3. Use provided scripts or notebooks to train and evaluate the model.
4. Customize or experiment for better intrusion detection.
